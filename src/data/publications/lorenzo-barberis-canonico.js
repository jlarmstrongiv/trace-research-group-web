    abstract: `
    Internet technologies have created unprecedented opportunities for people to come together and through their collective effort generate large amounts of data about human behavior. With the increased popularity of grounded theory, many researchers have sought to use ever-increasingly large datasets to analyze and draw patterns about social dynamics. However, the data is simply too big to enable a single human to derive effective models for many complex social phenomena. Computational methods offer a unique opportunity to analyze a wide spectrum of sociological events by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Within the human factors community, machine learning has emerged as the dominant AI-approach to deal with big data. However, along with its many benefits, machine learning has introduced a unique challenge: interpretability. The models of macro-social behavior generated by AI are so complex that rarely can they translated into human understanding. We propose a new method to conduct grounded theory research by leveraging the power of machine learning to analyze complex social phenomena through social network analysis while retaining interpretability as a core feature.

      Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors andnurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machinelearning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment processin an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirelyon delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligenceinto management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaoticand complex environments.

    abstract: `
      With multi-agent teams becoming more of a reality every day, it is important to create a common design model for multi-agent teams. These teams need to be able to function in dynamic environments and still communicate with any humans that may need a problem solved. Existing human-agent research can be used to purposefully create multi-agent teams that are interdependent but can still interact with humans. Rather than creating dynamic agents, the most effective way to overcome the dynamic nature of modern workloads is to create a dynamic team configuration, rather than individual member-agents that can change their roles. Multi-agent teams will require a variety of agents to be designed to cover a diverse subset of problems that need to be solved in the modern workforce. A model based on existing multi-agent teams that satisfies the needs of human-agent teams has been created to serve as a baseline for human-interactive multi-agent teams.

      In this paper we propose a new model for teamwork that integrates team cognition, collective intelligence, and artificial intelligence. We do this by first characterizing what sets team cognition and collectively intelligence apart, and then reviewing the literature on “superforecasting” and the ability for effectively coordinated teams to outperform predictions by large groups. Lastly, we delve into the ways in which teamwork can be enhanced by artificial intelligence through our model, finally highlighting the many areas of research worth exploring through interdisciplinary efforts.

      There is an ever-growing literature on the power of prediction markets to harness “the wisdom of the crowd” from large groups of people. However, traditional prediction markets are not designed in a human-centered way, often restricting their own potential. This creates the opportunity to implement a cognitive science perspective on how to enhance the collective intelligence of the participants. Thus, we propose a new model for prediction markets that integrates human factors, cognitive science, game theory and machine learning to maximize collective intelligence. We do this by first identifying the connections between prediction markets and collective intelligence, to then use human factors techniques to analyze our design, culminating in the practical ways with which our design enables artificial intelligence to complement human intelligence.

      Healthcare practitioners today find themselves confronting a multitude of diverse and complex tasks while under time-sensitive conditions. This dynamic is particularly apparent in the operating room, where for each operation, doctors and nurses have to make sure each surgery condition is optimal to avoid surgery complications and the spread of infections. Checklists are a helpful tool to avoid glossing over these critical steps, but their current implementation is outdated and does not leverage human-centered technology. We propose a checklist design for operating rooms that is generated by an intelligent system and is interacted with through a voice interface. By removing this burden away from the nursing staff, routine safety procedures can be expedited, and practitioners can redirect their full attention to the operation at hand.

      As AI advances and becomes more complicated, it becomes necessary to study the safety implications of its behavior. This paper expands upon prior AI-safety research to create a model to study the harmful outcomes of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we outline previous work that has highlighted multiple aspects of AI-safety research and focus on AI-safety systems in multi-agent systems. After overviewing previous literature, we present a model focused on flash crashes, a concept often found in economics. The model was constructed using an interdisciplinary approach that includes game theory, machine learning, cognitive science and systems theory to study flash crashes in complex human-AI systems. We use the model to study a complex interaction between AI-agents, and our results indicate the multi-agent system in question is prone to cause flash crashes.
