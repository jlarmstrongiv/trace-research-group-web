    abstract: `
      In case of emergencies (e.g., earthquakes, flooding), rapid responses are needed in order to address victims' requests for help. Social media used around crises involves self-organizing behavior that can produce accurate results, often in advance of official communications. This allows affected population to send tweets or text messages, and hence, make them heard. The ability to classify tweets and text messages automatically, together with the ability to deliver the relevant information to the appropriate personnel are essential for enabling the personnel to timely and efficiently work to address the most urgent needs, and to understand the emergency situation better. In this study, we developed a reusable information technology infrastructure, called Enhanced Messaging for the Emergency Response Sector (EMERSE). The components of EMERSE are: (i) an iPhone application; (ii) a Twitter crawler component; (iii) machine translation; and (iv) automatic message classification. While each component is important in itself and deserves a detailed analysis, in this paper we focused on the automatic classification component, which classifies and aggregates tweets and text messages about the Haiti disaster relief so that they can be easily accessed by non-governmental organizations, relief workers, people in Haiti, and their friends and families.

      The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking, crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists' and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices.

      As AI advances and becomes more complicated, it becomes necessary to study the safety implications of its behavior. This paper expands upon prior AI-safety research to create a model to study the harmful outcomes of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we outline previous work that has highlighted multiple aspects of AI-safety research and focus on AI-safety systems in multi-agent systems. After overviewing previous literature, we present a model focused on flash crashes, a concept often found in economics. The model was constructed using an interdisciplinary approach that includes game theory, machine learning, cognitive science and systems theory to study flash crashes in complex human-AI systems. We use the model to study a complex interaction between AI-agents, and our results indicate the multi-agent system in question is prone to cause flash crashes.

    abstract: `
      There is an ever-growing literature on the power of prediction markets to harness “the wisdom of the crowd” from large groups of people. However, traditional prediction markets are not designed in a human-centered way, often restricting their own potential. This creates the opportunity to implement a cognitive science perspective on how to enhance the collective intelligence of the participants. Thus, we propose a new model for prediction markets that integrates human factors, cognitive science, game theory and machine learning to maximize collective intelligence. We do this by first identifying the connections between prediction markets and collective intelligence, to then use human factors techniques to analyze our design, culminating in the practical ways with which our design enables artificial intelligence to complement human intelligence.

      With multi-agent teams becoming more of a reality every day, it is important to create a common design model for multi-agent teams. These teams need to be able to function in dynamic environments and still communicate with any humans that may need a problem solved. Existing human-agent research can be used to purposefully create multi-agent teams that are interdependent but can still interact with humans. Rather than creating dynamic agents, the most effective way to overcome the dynamic nature of modern workloads is to create a dynamic team configuration, rather than individual member-agents that can change their roles. Multi-agent teams will require a variety of agents to be designed to cover a diverse subset of problems that need to be solved in the modern workforce. A model based on existing multi-agent teams that satisfies the needs of human-agent teams has been created to serve as a baseline for human-interactive multi-agent teams.

      Team resilience is an interactive and dynamic process that develops over time while a team maintains performance. This study aims to empirically investigate systems-level resilience in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) System simulated task environment by examining team interaction during novel events. The approach used in the current study to measure systems-level resilience was developed by Hoffman & Hancock (2017). In their conceptual study, resilience was considered a key feature of success in emerging complex sociotechnical systems; in our case, that is applied to Human-Autonomy Teams (HATs). Hoffman and Hancock conceptualized a resilience measure dynamically by means of several components, such as the time it took the system to recognize and characterize anomalies, and the time taken to specify and achieve new goals. In their framework, there were two main sub-events which expressed resilience via time-based measures, and upon which we designed ours in this study: (1) time taken to design a new process and (2) time required to implement it (Hoffman & Hancock, 2017).

    abstract: `
        The emergence of various interest-based online communities has led to the popularity of new forms of distributed creative teamwork such as citizen science, crowdsourcing, and open source software development. These new phenomena further complicate the context and content of distributed creative teamwork: what are the characteristics of these new forms of creative teams? And how do they shape people’s perceptions and social experiences of distributed creative teams? In this paper, we report our empirical research of the team characteristics and practices in a creativity-centric technology community (i.e., independent [indie] game development) in hopes of exploring these questions. Our findings show that 1) indie game development teams are formed upon shared aspirations and use various strategies to collaborate with friends or online strangers; and their team practices are achieved through a balance between individual creativity and collective vision as well as a collaborative learning for problem solving and self-improvement; and 2) these teams mediate new forms of social interaction and collaborative experiences, featuring a mix of online comradery and weak social ties, and a mix of self-confidence and self-confliction. Using this new dataset and research context, we confirm and extend existing theories of distributed creative teams in CSCW. We also argue that studying these small-scale, self-selected, and interest-based teams can inform the design of collaborative systems to support various creative teams’ social needs.

      In future urban search and rescue teams, robots may be expected to conduct cognitive tasks. As the capabilities of robots change, so too will their interdependence with human teammates. Human factors and cognitive engineering are well-positioned to guide the design of autonomy for effective teaming. Previous work in the urban search and rescue synthetic task environment (USAR-STE) used Minecraft, a customizable gaming platform. In this effort, we advanced the USAR-STE by increasing interdependence in dyadic human-robot teaming through the Coactive Design framework. In this framework, we defined required capacities of victim identification in USAR from literature, and used them as inputs for modeling interdependence, and determined recommendations that would enhance interdependence in the task environment. Although Coactive Design is typically used to design interdependence for robots or jobs, we demonstrated how it can also be used to design an experimental team task environment.

      Team Situation Awareness (TSA), which is a part of team cognition, is a critical factor that influences team effectiveness. It can be defined as getting the right information from the right person within the right amount of time, in order to overcome an unexpected event (Gorman, Cooke, Pederson, Connor, & DeJoode, 2005). TSA is developed and maintained through team interactions, allowing for the measurement of TSA based on team interaction (Cooke & Gorman, 2009). In the current study, a specific measure, Coordinated Awareness of Situation by Teams (CAST) is used (Cooke & Gorman, 2009). CAST evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of team interaction under “roadblock” scenarios (Gorman, Cooke, & Winner, 2006). These roadblocks represent novel situations in the task and require effective team communication and coordination. Team members must assess the situation according to their own specialized role and/or resources and coordinate with other team members to overcome each separate roadblock. In this task, effective communication refers to team anticipation. That is, each team member needs to anticipate each other’s needs by pushing information rather than pulling information during the task (Demir, McNeese, & Cooke, 2017). In this study, we examined how pushing and pulling information, and CAST were associated with Team Situation Awareness (TSA) in both Human-Autonomy (HAT) and all-human teams in simulated Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) task environment.

      Project overview Teamwork can be defined as dynamic team interaction between two or more interdependent members to achieve a shared goal. Many studies have examined how coordination dynamics are associated with team effectiveness in the context of all-human teams (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010), and later, in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s (Demir, Likens, Cooke, Amazeen, & McNeese, 2018). HATs must have autonomous agents that act as effective teammates and help enable HATs to function as collaborative systems. Synergistic relationships among a system’s human and technological components provide the basis for emergent systems-level outcomes. Layered dynamics, a recent empirical modelling technique aimed at achieving this objective (Gorman et al., 2019), considers reorganization of the sociotechnical system across individual components and the overall system. The current study examined layered dynamics of HATs during automation and autonomy failures and addresses how members of HATs interact with each other and technological aspects of the system. Design and Method We utilized a simulated Remotely Piloted Aircrtaft System (RPAS) Synthetic Task Environment with three heteregeneous and interdepedent roles: (1) a navigator, who created a dynamic flight plan and provided waypoint related information; (2) a pilot, who used this information to monitor and adjust settings. The pilot also communicated with the photographer to negotiate settings and enable proper conditions to obtain a good photograph; and (3) a photographer, who monitored and adjusted the camera to take good target photos, and provided feedback to the team. This study utilized a Wizard of Oz paradigm, in which the navigator and photographer were instructed that the pilot was a synthetic agent. However, the pilot was a highly-trained experimenter, in a separate room, who simulated an autonomous agent using limited vocabulary. There were 22 teams, and two participants were randomly assigned to the navigator and photographer roles. This task was comprised of ten 40-minute missions, and teams needed to take as many good photos as possible while avoiding alarms and rule violations. The primary manipulation was the application of three degraded conditions: (1) automation failure - role-level display failures, (2) autonomy failure - autonomous agent’s abnormal behavior, and (3) malicious cyber-attacks - the hijaking of the RPAS, with the synthetic agent providing false, detrimental information. We symbolically represented RPAS using layered dynamics, and calculated entropy measures for each (Gorman et al., 2019): (1) communications: team members interacting within the chat system; (2) vehicle: states of the RPA, including airspeed/altitude, turns, fuel, battery, remaining film, and termperature level; and (3) controls: the interface controls between the RPA and the team members. To measure team performance, we used a time and coordination based metric for each target in each mission. Results and Discussion Our main findings were: 1) vehicle and communication entropy were higher than control entropy and were associated with better adaptation to both failures, and 2) control entropy had a negative association with initial status on team performance, while vehicle entropy had a positive association. These findings describe the tendency of low performing teams to anticipate targets poorly. This was due to a failure to interact with the technology in a timely manner. This lagged effect can be attributed to teams taking too long to interact with the technology. These findings shed light on how the layered dynamics approach can help understand team behavior under degraded conditions.

      Significant strides are being made to produce more transdisciplinary research in the systems, man, and cybernetics (SMC) community, which is inherently interdisciplinary. To produce effective transdisciplinary SMC work, perspectives from multiple disciplines must be integrated. Yet, continued work is still needed to help promote the transdisciplinary nature of SMC and encourage more transdisciplinary work in this area. This article offers eight recommendations for developing foundational transdisciplinary SMC-based research. These recommendations relate to the following areas: 1) academic training, 2) a shared and common language, 3) the need for transdisciplinarity, 4) problem space requirements, 5) shared spaces and mechanisms, 6) team science and cognition, 7) credit, and 8) metrics to measure transdisciplinary performance.

      The focus of this current research is twofold: (1) to understand how team interaction in human-autonomy teams (HAT)s evolve in the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) task context, and (2) to understand how HATs respond to three types of failures (automation, autonomy, and cyber-attack) over time. We summarize the findings from three of our recent experiments regarding the team interaction within HAT over time in the dynamic context of RPAS. For the first and the second experiments, we summarize general findings related to team member interaction of a three-member team over time, by comparison of HATs with all-human teams. In the third experiment, which extends beyond the first two experiments, we investigate HAT evolution when HATs are faced with three types of failures during the task. For all three of these experiments, measures focus on team interactions and temporal dynamics consistent with the theory of interactive team cognition. We applied Joint Recurrence Quantification Analysis, to communication flow in the three experiments. One of the most interesting and significant findings from our experiments regarding team evolution is the idea of entrainment, that one team member (the pilot in our study, either agent or human) can change the communication behaviors of the other teammates over time, including coordination, and affect team performance. In the first and second studies, behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams resulted in very stable and rigid coordination in comparison to the all-human teams that were less stable. Experimenter teams demonstrated metastable coordination (not rigid nor unstable) and performed better than rigid and unstable teams during the dynamic task. In the third experiment, metastable behavior helped teams overcome all three types of failures. These summarized findings address three potential future needs for ensuring effective HAT: (1) training of autonomous agents on the principles of teamwork, specifically understanding tasks and roles of teammates, (2) human-centered machine learning design of the synthetic agent so the agents can better understand human behavior and ultimately human needs, and (3) training of human members to communicate and coordinate with agents due to current limitations of Natural Language Processing of the agents.

      In this paper, we explore a network of distributed individuals’ collective efforts to establish an innovation ecology allowing them to engage in bottom up creative technological practices in today’s information society. Specifically, we present an empirical study of the technological practices in an emerging creative technology community – independent [indie] game developers in the United States. Based on indie game developers’ own accounts, we identified four themes that constitute an innovation ecology from the bottom up, including problem solving; collaborative information seeking, sharing, and reproducing; community support; and policy and politics. We argue that these findings inform our understanding of bottom up technological innovation and shed light on the design of sociotechnical systems to mediate and support such innovation beyond the gaming context.

      In the past, team coordination dynamics have been explored using nonlinear dynamical systems (NDS) methods, but the relationship between team coordination dynamics and team performance for all-human teams was assumed to be linear. The current study examines team coordination dynamics with an extended version of the NDS methods and assumes that its relationship with team performance for human-autonomy teams (HAT) is nonlinear. In this study, three team conditions are compared with the goals of better understanding how team coordination dynamics differ between all-human teams and HAT and how these dynamics relate to team performance and team situation awareness. Each condition was determined based on manipulation of the pilot role: in the first condition (synthetic) the pilot role was played by a synthetic agent, in the second condition (control) it was a randomly assigned participant, and in the third condition (experimenter) it was an expert who used a role specific coordination script. NDS indices revealed that synthetic teams were rigid, followed by experimenter teams, who were metastable, and control teams, who were unstable. Experimenter teams demonstrated better team effectiveness (i.e., better team performance and team situation awareness) than control and synthetic teams. Team coordination stability is related to team performance and team situation awareness in a nonlinear manner with optimal performance and situation awareness associated with metastability coupled with flexibility. This result means that future development of synthetic teams should address these coordination dynamics, specifically, rigidity in coordination.

      The aim of this exploratory paper is to underline the importance of coordination-based training for dynamic tasks in human-autonomy teaming. We address training solutions to distinct types of failures caused by either internal (the system) and external sources (the dynamic task environment). In order to accomplish this, we explore Human-Autonomy teaming communication and coordination with comprehensive scenarios drawn from the pilot tests and look at team needs to successfully overcome complex and dynamic failures. Findings from these two failure events are twofold: (1) in order to adapt to dynamic environments and overcome unexpected failures, teams should receive role-related training (static and knowledge-based) as well as training about how to interact with one another (dynamic and coordination-based) and (2) designing synthetic agents with effective team coordination mechanisms will help future team training exercises. Current and future work is focused on additional experimentation on team training in the context of Human-Autonomy teams. Furthermore, future experimentation should highlight additional requirements needed for designing synthetic teammates and also dynamic task training necessary to produce effective teamwork.

      The rise in autonomous system research and development combined with the maturation of computational cognitive architectures holds the promise of high-cognitive-fidelity agents capable of operating as team members for training. We report an ACT-R model capable of operating as a team member within a remotely-piloted aerial system, and provide results from a first-of-its-kind controlled, randomized empirical evaluation in which teams that worked with an AST were compared against all-human teams. Our results demonstrate that ASTs can be incorporated into human teams, providing training opportunities when teammates are unavailable. We conclude with issues faced in developing ASTs and lessons learned for future and current developers.

      Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors and nurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machine-learning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment process in an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirely on delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligence into management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaotic and complex environments.

      Internet technologies have created unprecedented opportunities for people to come together and through their collective effort generate large amounts of data about human behavior. With the increased popularity of grounded theory, many researchers have sought to use ever-increasingly large datasets to analyze and draw patterns about social dynamics. However, the data is simply too big to enable a single human to derive effective models for many complex social phenomena. Computational methods offer a unique opportunity to analyze a wide spectrum of sociological events by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. Within the human factors community, machine learning has emerged as the dominant AI-approach to deal with big data. However, along with its many benefits, machine learning has introduced a unique challenge: interpretability. The models of macro-social behavior generated by AI are so complex that rarely can they translated into human understanding. We propose a new method to conduct grounded theory research by leveraging the power of machine learning to analyze complex social phenomena through social network analysis while retaining interpretability as a core feature.

      Healthcare practitioners today find themselves confronting a multitude of diverse and complex tasks while under time-sensitive conditions. This dynamic is particularly apparent in the operating room, where for each operation, doctors and nurses have to make sure each surgery condition is optimal to avoid surgery complications and the spread of infections. Checklists are a helpful tool to avoid glossing over these critical steps, but their current implementation is outdated and does not leverage human-centered technology. We propose a checklist design for operating rooms that is generated by an intelligent system and is interacted with through a voice interface. By removing this burden away from the nursing staff, routine safety procedures can be expedited, and practitioners can redirect their full attention to the operation at hand.

      Adaptive complex team behaviors evolve dynamically and occur in many different environments. In this study, we examined the role of these behaviors and their relationship with team performance in the context of human-autonomy teams (HAT) and all-human teams. The HAT served as the “synthetic” condition in which two human team members were informed that the third team member was a “synthetic” agent; in the control condition, the team members were informed that the pilot was a remotely located human teammate. Following are the primary findings from this study: first, control teams demonstrated better performance than the synthetic teams; second, control teams were more active than the synthetic teams in terms of planning the task, and third, the behavioral passiveness of the synthetic teams (due to lack of planning) associated with diminished team performance. This suggests that the synthetic teams did not show enough adaptive complex behaviors that were evident in control teams. This finding implies that merely believing the pilot to be a synthetic agent made it more difficult for synthetic teams to plan and, thus, effectively anticipate their teammates’ needs. In addition, this study highlights that there is a significant need for humans to gain experience in working with a synthetic agent to overcome negative perceptions.

      In Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT), the development of a highly autonomous agent as a team member is difficult. Similar to human-human teaming, there are multiple dimensions of social behaviors that occur during HAT that must be accounted for within the development of the agent or system. One of these dimensions is team synchrony. In general, team synchrony is, when two systems (or two individuals in a team) are synchronized, resulting in their recurrences being dependent on each other. In order for a human-autonomy team to be synchronous the agent must communicate effectively (i.e., synchronize effectively) with its human team members. Thus, in this paper we present a conceptual discussion on what team synchrony is, how it occurs, and how to better develop it in HAT. To ground our discussion, we use our recent studies in which we empirically looked at team behaviors and team synchrony of HAT.

      Objective Three different team configurations are compared with the goal of better understanding human-autonomy teaming (HAT). Background Although an extensive literature on human-automation interaction exists, much less is known about HAT in which humans and autonomous agents interact as coordinated units. Further research must be conducted to better understand how all-human teams compare to HAT. Methods In an unmanned aerial system (UAS) context, a comparison was made among three types of three-member teams: (1) synthetic teams in which the pilot role is assigned to a synthetic teammate, (2) control teams in which the pilot was an inexperienced human, and (3) experimenter teams in which an experimenter served as an experienced pilot. Ten of each type of team participated. Measures of team performance, target processing efficiency, team situation awareness, and team verbal behaviors were analyzed. Results Synthetic teams performed as well at the mission level as control (all human) teams but processed targets less efficiently. Experimenter teams performed better across all other measures compared to control and synthetic teams. Conclusion Though there is potential for a synthetic agent to function as a full-fledged teammate, further advances in autonomy are needed to improve team-level dynamics in HAT teams. Application This research contributes to our understanding of how to make autonomy a good team player.

      Project overview. The current study focuses on the nature of team coordination dynamics within all-human teams and Human-Autonomy Teams (HAT) in the context of the development of a fully-fledged synthetic agent that is a computational cognitive model for a three-agent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ground crew. In this study, the relationship between team coordination dynamics and team performance within the HAT and all-human teams is considered. To serve as a teammate, the synthetic agent must be able to communicate and coordinate with its human teammates in a constructive and timely manner (Demir, McNeese, & Cooke, 2016). In this current research, there were three heterogeneous team members who communicated via a text-based communication system to photograph target waypoints. Each team member had a different role: (1) navigator – provides information regarding a flight plan with speed and altitude restrictions of each waypoint; (2) pilot – controls the UAS by adjusting its altitude and airspeed by negotiating with the photographer to take a good photo for the target waypoints; and (3) photographer – screens camera settings, and sends feedback to the other team members regarding the status of target’s photograph. At each target waypoint, this coordination sequence among the team members, called Information-Negotiation-Feedback (INF), is captured by a Kappa Score (Gorman, Amazeen, & Cooke, 2010) that describes the sequence and timing of the information coordination. Three conditions were created that manipulated the pilot role: (1) Synthetic – pilot was the synthetic agent, (2) Control – pilot was a randomly assigned participant, and (3) Experimenter – pilot was an experimenter who was highly experienced with the task and focused on pushing and pulling the information in a timely manner.

    abstract: `
      A novel joint decision making paradigm for assessing team coordination was developed and tested using baseball infielders. Balls launched onto an infield at different trajectories were filmed using four video cameras that were each placed at one of the typical positions of the four infielders. Each participant viewed temporally occluded videos for one of the four positions and were asked to say either " ball " if they would attempt to field it or the name of the bag that they would cover. The evaluation of two experienced coaches was used to assign a group coordination score for each trajectory and group decision times were calculated. Thirty groups of 4 current college baseball players were: (i) teammates (players from same team/view from own position), (ii) non-teammates (players from different teams/view from own position), or (iii) scrambled teammates (players from same team/view not from own position). Teammates performed significantly better (i.e., faster and more coordinated decisions) than the other two groups, whereas scrambled teammates performed significantly better than non-teammates. These findings suggest that team coordination is achieved through both experience with one's teammates' responses to particular events (e.g., a ball hit up the middle) and one's own general action capabilities (e.g., running speed). The sensitivity of our joint decision making paradigm to group makeup provides support for its use as a method for studying team coordination.

    abstract: `
      Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) have become one of the deadliest threats to military personnel, resulting in over 50% of American combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Identification of IED emplacement is conducted by mission payload operators (MPOs). Yet, experienced MPOs are limited in number, making MPO training a critical intervention. In this article, we implement a Cognitive Engineering Based on Expert Skill methodology to better understand how experienced MPOs identify the emplacement of IEDs for the purposes of improving training. First, expert knowledge was elicited through interviews and questionnaires to identify the types of perceptual cues used and how these cues are cognitively processed. Results indicate that there are many different static and dynamic cues that interact with each other over time and space. Using data from the interviews and questionnaires, an empirically grounded framework is presented that explains the cognitive process of IED emplacement detection. Using the overall findings and the framework, IED emplacement training scenarios were developed and built into a simulation.

      Historically, domains such as business intelligence would require a single analyst to engage with data, develop a model, answer operational questions, and predict future behaviors. However, as the problems and domains become more complex, organizations are employing teams of analysts to explore and model data to generate knowledge. Furthermore, given the rapid increase in data collection, organizations are struggling to develop practices for intelligence analysis in the era of big data. Currently, a variety of machine learning and data mining techniques are available to model data and to generate insights and predictions, and developments in the field of visual analytics have focused on how to effectively link data mining algorithms with interactive visuals to enable analysts to explore, understand, and interact with data and data models. Although studies have explored the role of single analysts in the visual analytics pipeline, little work has explored the role of teamwork and visual analytics in the analysis of big data. In this article, we present an experiment integrating statistical models, visual analytics techniques, and user experiments to study the role of teamwork in predictive analytics. We frame our experiment around the analysis of social media data for box office prediction problems and compare the prediction performance of teams, groups, and individuals. Our results indicate that a team's performance is mediated by the team's characteristics such as openness of individual members to others' positions and the type of planning that goes into the team's analysis. These findings have important implications for how organizations should create teams in order to make effective use of information from their analytic models.

      In contemporary society, teamwork is prominent as a critical component in many complex environments. Much of the success of teamwork is coupled with both team cognition and the contextual surround that a team is required to perform in. Over the last thirty years there have been various formulations of team simulations that represent team cognition and the context in various ways—some more beneficial than others. This paper examines numerous practical considerations, lessons learned, and insights developed over specific team simulations that our research group has engaged with over the years.

    abstract: `
      Sports are an important aspect of almost every culture and have also helped to define what most people consider a team. Like sports, teams permeate society. Teamwork that occurs within sports teams generally consists of physical coordination and cognitive processing. The interaction between physical coordination and cognitive processing at the team level or team cognition drives teamwork. Team cognition is a rich research area, yet studies of team cognition and team sports have been minimal. Team cognition has been studied from one of two different perspectives: information processing/shared knowledge and ecological. Though each perspective is useful, most research on team cognition work has taken the information processing/shared knowledge approach. In this chapter, we review each perspective, and assess each in regards to the context of team sports. We conclude by recommending an integrative perspective, utilizing aspects of both team cognition perspectives, to study team cognition during team sports.

      Effective team communication, a fundamental part of team coordination, is crucial for both effective Team Situation Awareness (TSA) and team performance. In this study, we looked at the role that team interaction (i.e., more specifically team verbal behaviors) played in TSA and team performance in order to better understand Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). We first analyzed team verbal behaviors (i.e., pushing and pulling information) across conditions of human-autonomy teams and human-human teams, and then analyzed their relationship with TSA and team performance via Growth Curve Modelling (GCM). Good teamwork involves anticipating the needs of teammates and that means pushing information before it is requested. Therefore, if things are going well, there should be little need for pulling information. In this study’s task, participants were instructed to push information to others, and over time master the specific timing of information sharing to the intended recipient. Findings indicate that Pushing information was positively associated with TSA and team performance, and human-autonomy teams had lower levels of both pushing and pulling information than all-human teams. Through this study, we have learned that anticipation of other team member behaviors and information requirements in human-autonomy teams are important for effective TSA and team performance. In order to make HAT more effective in terms of teamwork, we need to develop mechanisms to enhance pushing information within HAT.

      As unmanned extraction vehicles become a reality in the military theater, opportunities to augment medical operations with telesurgical robotics become more plausible. This project demonstrated an experimental surgical robot using an unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) as a network topology. Because battlefield operations are dynamic and geographically challenging, the installation of wireless networks is not a feasible option at this point. However, to utilize telesurgical robotics to assist in the urgent medical care of wounded soldiers, a robust, high bandwidth, low latency network is requisite. For the first time, a mobile surgical robotic system was deployed to an austere environment and surgeons were able to remotely operate the systems wirelessly using a UAV. Two University of Cincinnati surgeons were able to remotely drive the University of Washington’s RAVEN robot’s end effectors. The network topology demonstrated a highly portable, quickly deployable, bandwidth-sufficient and low latency wireless network required for battlefield use.

      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an important and complex treatment modality for a variety of hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. Although outcomes of patients who have undergone HCT and require care in intensive care units (ICUs) have improved over time, mortality rates remain high and there are significant associated costs. Lack of a team-based approach to care, especially during critical illness, is detrimental to patient autonomy and satisfaction, and to team morale, ultimately leading to poor quality of care. In this manuscript, we describe the case of a patient who had undergone HCT and was in the ICU setting, where inconsistent team interaction among the various stakeholders delivering care resulted in a lack of shared goals and poor outcomes. Team cognition is cognitive processing at the team level through interactions among team members and is reflected in dynamic communication and coordination behaviors. Although the patient received multidisciplinary care as needed in a medically complicated case, a lack of team cognition and, particularly, inconsistent communication among the dynamic teams caring for the patient, led to mixed messages being delivered with high-cost implications for the health-care system and the family. This article highlights concepts and recommendations that begin a necessary in-depth assessment of implications for clinical care and initiate a research agenda that examines the effects of team cognition on HCT teams, and, more generally, critical care of the patient with cancer.

      Intelligent teamwork means many things to many people. This paper provides a historical foundation to various elements of human-agent collaboration, leading to the identification of research needs and challenges that are often present when teamwork is seen from the vantage point of cognitive augmentation. A broad research framework consisting of four meshed phases derives from the historical foundation and research needs and challenges to help integrate multifarious considerations involving information, technology, people, and environment is presented. Examples and lessons learned associated with each phase are provided to help articulate requisite bottlenecks and tradeoffs that inevitability arise when agents, aids, and interfaces are purposefully human-centered in their approach. The objectives of understanding, usefulness, usability, and context are examined in consort with each phase.

      Project overview. The current project is part of a larger effort that focuses on Human-Automation Teaming (HAT) interaction in the context of the development, integration, and validation of a computational cognitive model that acts as a full-fledged synthetic teammate for a three-agent Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) ground control crew. Our most recent effort looked at team process and team performance within the HAT. In order to be considered a team player, the synthetic teammate must be able to communicate and coordinate with its human teammates and do so in a subtle manner (Demir et al., 2016). In this task, there were three different and interdependent team members: 1) Air Vehicle Operator (AVO) – controls the UAS’s heading, altitude, and airspeed; 2) Data Exploitation, Mission Planning, and Communications (DEMPC) – provides a dynamic flight plan as well as speed and altitude restrictions; and 3) Payload Operator (PLO) – monitors sensor equipment, negotiates with the AVO, and takes photographs of target waypoints. The communication within a three-agent UAS team occurred over a text-based communications system. In this research, there were three conditions which are differentiated by the AVO role: 1) the Synthetic - the synthetic teammate was assigned the AVO role; 2) the Control - the AVO was an inexperienced human participant; 3) the Experimenter - the AVO was one of the experimenters who was experienced with the task. The experimenter AVO asked questions of other team members to ensure timely and adaptive passing of information at target waypoints. In this current study, the coordination among the team members occurs at each target waypoint and requires a specific sequence of information passing for an optimum team performance (Cooke, Gorman, Duran, & Taylor, 2007): the information is provided by the DEMPC about the upcoming target waypoint to the AVO. After that, the PLO and the AVO negotiate regarding an appropriate altitude and airspeed for the target waypoints about required camera settings. Finally, the PLO sends feedback to other team members about the status of the target photo.

      Human Systems Integration (HSI) is a discipline in which human capabilities and limitations across various dimensions are considered in the context of the design and evaluation of a dynamic system of people, technology, environment, tasks, organization, and other systems with the ultimate goal of achieving system resilience and adaptation, approaching joint optimization. An HSI perspective is described in the context of the Two Eagles mission, in which two pilots crossed the Pacific Ocean in a gas balloon. The two pilots set both the record for the longest duration and for the longest distance in a gas balloon. The system extended far beyond the balloon and the two pilots. It was complex and distributed around the world. There were many challenges associated with HSI issues, which are detailed in this paper and exemplify the value of a systems perspective.

      Extreme environments often profoundly impact one’s cognition and subsequently the ability to make accurate and correct decisions. Although we are beginning to understand how these environments impact individual and team cognition, more specific work conducted in real extreme environments is needed to further understand this relationship. In this paper, we present data collected in the extreme environment of gas ballooning. Recently, the Two Eagles gas ballooning project set two absolute world records: longest duration in a gas balloon and longest distance in a gas balloon. During this project, our research team was able to collect cognitive abilities data and data on the effects of multiple stressors in the environment. We present the overall project along with some insights from the data. We also highlight lessons learned from attempting to collect data in an extreme environment.

      Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are steadily increasing in their presence and role in the Military’s overall strategic operational picture. The benefits of RPAS are apparent, ranging from saving time, money, and lives. Yet, the utilization of RPAS is still very challenging in many different aspects. Teams have become a central focus of RPAS due to their many benefits. Yet, teamwork is challenging and the RPAS community must continue to attempt to understand how to support it. A specific aspect of teamwork that has proven over the years to be of paramount importance is team cognition. In this paper, we discuss how team cognition needs to be considered during the development of collaborative and proactive RPAS decision support. We highlight the concept of team cognition accounting for multiple perspectives, outline an integrative perspective of team cognition for the RPAS domain, and conclude by outlining multiple design objectives for utilizing team cognition as a mechanism for RPAS decision support.

      Background: The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that annually there are approximately 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). Hospitals have implemented multidisciplinary teams trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) to provide care during these events. Outcome measures of these team’s effectiveness are typically mortality rates at discharge and reduction of unplanned cardiac arrest occurring outside of the ICU. Neither is a sensitive measure of team effectiveness. Methods: Using a retrospective analysis of 10 simulated code blue events we developed a metric of team effectiveness for code blue teams that also identifies specific teamwork weaknesses. Results: The new ASU-Mayo metric was highly correlated with Mayo high performance team scale (MHPTS) (r (6) = .71), team emergency assessment measure (TEAM) (r (6) = .84), and the observational skill-based assessment tool for resuscitation (OSCAR) (r (6) = .89) metrics as well as the ratings of the subject matter experts (r (6) = .88). Conclusions: We developed a team performance metric that allows for the identification of performance gaps therefore, can allow for targeted intervention with the intention of providing trainees richer feedback on performance. Also, it will generate quantitative assessments of the value of mock code exercises and can be used to evaluate interventions. Our understanding of teamwork during a simulated code blue event was also enhanced.

      If synthetic teammates are to be considered "team players", then they must be better equipped to handle the subtleties of communication and coordination with their human teammates. In this study, the team communication behaviors of a human-automation team were analyzed for the identification of which are the best predictors of team performance. The LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method was used to select the team communication behaviors that were the best predictors of team performance and, in the end, 16 such role related communication behaviors (at both the role and condition level) were included in the final model. Findings indicate that in general, negatively perceived communication behaviors are predictors of negative team performance. Through this study, we also learned that even when human team members follow their optimal and expected communication behaviors when communicating with a synthetic teammate, these behaviors are still predictors of negative team performance. This finding holds important future considerations: even if human team members are properly communicating with a synthetic teammate, the errors and lack of human-like behavior on the part of the latter can still result in a negative team performance.

      For most people, the concept of a team is most often associated with the context of sports. Sports permeate our society and are a critical form of entertainment for many. Fans of sports teams intently watch their team, often thinking little about the many complexities involved in any given team sport. Yet, the complexities are many, and one serious area that is historically understudied is the development of team cognition within sports teams. Sports teams are dynamic, in that they rely on both physical and cognitive dimensions of teamwork to be effective. A sports team does not only focus on strategy or developing a game plan to beat their opponent (cognitive), they must also execute this on the field of play (perceptual motor). The integration of both cognition and physical execution is dependent on the development of team cognition. Team cognition allows team members to develop an understanding of their overall strategic goals and implement them on the field. Thus, the development of team cognition within sports has the potential to greatly improve performance. Yet, to fully understand how team cognition develops within sports teams and its impact on and off the field, we need to study the developmental process more within this specific context. As with any domain specific area, conceptual/theoretical approaches and research methodologies must be identified as meaningful for the selected research context. This paper presents and describes theoretical approaches that are useful for studying sports and team cognition. Specifically, this paper explores and describes the theory of Interactive Team Cognition [1] as a perspective and approach to studying the development and implications of team cognition within team sports. As previously noted, sports are a highly dynamic activity and dependent on many functions (communication, coordination, collaboration) to be effective. The theory of Interactive Team Cognition directly aligns with these functions, acknowledging that team cognition is an activity (sports is) that is highly dependent on the context that it is occurring in. In addition, the theory also states that it is best to study and measure team cognition when the team is the unit of analysis. In this paper, we also present methods for how researchers can study team cognition within sports teams. The paper concludes with an overview of the potential to study team cognition within sports teams using the aforementioned approaches and methods.

      Human Factors has informed both research and practice for over 100 years [1]. In this time, many theories, methods, and design practices have been implemented. As a result, the way Human Factors as a discipline has been conceptualized and put into practice has undergone numerous changes. Human Factors, at its heart is the idea that technology influences humans, and that humans influence the performance efficiency and effectiveness of technology, and other humans. Recent approaches to Human Factors have created multiple baseline assumptions on understanding human system interaction. For example, McNeese et al. [2] identified four systems design paradigms wherein each produce a qualitatively different outcome: Technology-Centered, User-Centered, Data-Centered, Group-Centered. Although there is value and truth in each approach, individually each theme limits its scope by deemphasizing contributions from the others. Because isomorphic approaches abound in the field, this paper theorizes a more optimal approach to contemporary human factors - The Living Laboratory Framework – that posits a wholistic perspective addressing various underling parameters in complex problem solving and innovative design. In this contemporary approach, the theory–problems–practice becomes highly integrated, reflecting unique and dynamic methods to create human-system integration. Examples are provided in the domains of cyber operations and police cognition to demonstrate the value of this approach.

      Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is of growing importance in the information sciences and human– computer interaction (HCI) research communities. Current research has primarily focused on examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational or other settings and developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. As we continue to develop a better understanding of the interactional aspects of CIS, we need also start to examine the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, we need to understand CIS from a team cognition perspective. To examine how team cognition develops during CIS, we conducted a study using observations and interviews of student teams engaged in colo-cated CIS tasks in a laboratory setting. We found that a variety of awareness mechanisms play a key role in the development of team cognition during CIS. Specifically, we identify that search, information, and social methods of awareness are critical to developing team cognition during CIS. We discuss why awareness is important for team cognition, how team cognition comprises both individual and team-level cognitive activities, and the importance of examining both interaction and cognition to truly understand team cognition.

      Over the years, the human factors community has identified many challenges and complexities associated with intelligence analysis, many directly related to cognition. The pressures that intelligence analysts must deal with on a day-to-day basis stretch one’s cognitive bandwidth. Through a review of human factors related intelligence analysis research, this paper presents multiple cognitive challenges that impact intelligence analysts’ work. In response to these challenges, the authors outline ways in which human factors can be beneficial to alleviating many of the challenges. Finally, the authors introduce the Living Lab approach as a valuable and unique means for understanding the cognitive science of intelligence analysis.

      Because teams are constantly evolving, we must continue to work towards understanding team cognition development. One particular example of this is the continued efforts towards understanding developmental differences in co-located and distributed mediums. Both of these settings are imperative and critical to teamwork. As individuals become more mobile and less physically connected, supporting teamwork in distributed settings is becoming more and more important. In this paper, we present a study focused on the development of a team mental model (TMM) of collaborative information seeking (CIS) in a distributed setting. The study’s findings provide insights into how a TMM specific to CIS develops within a distributed medium, highlighting specific aspects that help and hurt development. Concluding thoughts are presented with the aim to further understand how TMMs develop differently within the contexts of co-located and distributed mediums.

      Intelligence analysis is changing in its the breadth and scope, bringing forth many new problems and challenges. Problems are increasing in volume, scope, and context. In response to changes, new technologies and the utilization of teams to conduct analysis have become imperative. Yet, though both are individually perceived as important, less consideration is given to collaborative technologies in intelligence analysis. More specifically, there is limited understanding of how to develop and design them in a meaningful and impactful way for the analysts. In this paper, through a review of the literature, our own work, and anecdotal reports from subject matter experts, we outline multiple human factors guidelines that are beneficial in studying and designing collaborative intelligence analysis technologies and tools. We conclude by highlighting multiple challenges specific to developing collaborative technologies in intelligence analysis.

      Intelligence analysis (IA) has long been a topic of interest for the human factors community, leading to an increased understanding of the analytical process and many new insights. Yet, the scope and breadth of IA is growing and evolving for many different reasons. IA is more dynamic and multi-faceted than it has ever been. The process of IA is changing due to expanding sensor data, new methods of work, new technologies, and new challenges. In addition, the scope and context of IA is greater than ever, including focuses such as healthcare, climate change, and cyber security (to name a few). In response to these changes, a few key questions emerge. Panel discussants will provide insights into how IA is changing, how researchers should adapt to this change, how researchers should acquire access to study IA, and if there are there underlying assumptions and themes of IA that are true across different domains.

      A synthetic teammate based on ACT-R cognitive architecture has been developed to function as an Air Vehicle Operator in the context of a three-agent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) ground control team taking part in studies in a Synthetic Task Environment (STE). In order for the synthetic teammate to function as team player with human teammates, it needs to skillfully handle the subtleties of team communication and coordination. Data from early synthetic teammate interactions with two human teammates are presented here to illustrate team communication and coordination challenges for the synthetic teammate. In turn, the synthetic teammate limitations have highlighted the intricacies involved in effective teamwork. Communication, though a terrifically challenging problem in itself, is only a foundation for coordinated teamwork or interacting as a team player.

      The importance of collaborative information seeking (CIS) during team decision-making is starting to be examined within the human factors community. Without the ability to collaborate to seek and retrieve information, a team cannot make accurate decisions. One area of particular importance to CIS is individual and team cognition. Through previous research, we know that cognition is critical to the performance of many collaborative efforts. Yet, there has been little research on the relationship of cognition to CIS. Consequently, appropriate methods to use and how to use them have not been clearly identified. One useful approach to understanding cognition during CIS is to implement a concept mapping methodology. In this paper, we discuss concept mapping and utilize it in a laboratory study focused on understanding the role of cognition during CIS. Through analysis of CIS oriented individual and team concept maps, we gained insights into how people cognitively perceive CIS.

      Team decision-making (TDM) is composed of many activities. One important aspect of TDM is information seeking, particularly collaborative information seeking (CIS). Within CIS research, the role of team cognition and the development of team mental models (TMMs) have not been well-studied. In this paper, we examine the development of TMMs during CIS activities. Utilizing qualitative knowledge elicitation methods, we conducted an exploratory laboratory-based study of student teams working on CIS tasks. We report on how the teams describe TMM development, the teamwork and taskwork aspects of the TMM, and the attributes supporting TMM development. The results highlight that the process of TMM development during CIS is similar to TMM development research reported in other studies. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research to attempt to understand the role of team cognition in CIS and describe the development of a TMM specific to CIS.

    abstract: `
      Teamwork has become one of the hallmarks of emergency crisis management (ECM). Success in managing emergency situations is highly dependent on teams working together to accomplish prioritized goals. Therefore, given the importance of teamwork, team cognition has been realized as an important component to address the emerging complexity, extreme workload, and uncertain conditions that can underlie emergency response. Many variables affect teams and their subsequent cognition. Understanding the effects of awareness, attention, temporality, common ground, team mental model development, and culture on team cognition provides insight into effective and efficient management of emergencies. As a research group, for more than a decade, we have studied team cognition within the context of ECM through the basis of simulations using the NeoCITIES platform. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences using the NeoCITIES platform to conduct basic team cognitive research and share our visions for future research trajectories for the greater Human Factors community.

      Electronic medical record (EMR) systems are used by a wide variety of users. However, current research on the design and use of the EMR primarily focuses on clinical users such as physicians and nurses. While it is important to understand EMR use by clinicians, there is also a need to understand how non-clinicians use these systems because of the important role they play in the patient-care process. In this note, we present results of an ethnographic field study on the use and perceptions of EMR systems by non-clinicians in an emergency department. We then discuss design implications that can improve the system usability and strengthen the empowerment of these non-clinicians.

    abstract: `
        A survey of rural hospitals was conducted in the spring of 2012 to better understand their perspectives on health information technology (HIT) outsourcing and the role that hospital-to-hospital HIT partnerships (HHPs) can play as an outsourcing mechanism. The survey sought to understand how HHPs might be leveraged for HIT implementation, as well as the challenges with forming them. The results suggest that HHPs have the potential to address rural hospitals' slow rate of HIT adoption, but there are also challenges to creating these partnerships. These issues, as well as avenues for further research, are then discussed.

    abstract: `
      The preparation of next generation analyst work requires alternative levels of understanding and new methodological departures from the way current work transpires. Current work practices typically do not provide a comprehensive approach that emphasizes the role of and interplay between (a) cognition, (b) emergent activities in a shared situated context, and (c) collaborative teamwork. In turn, effective and efficient problem solving fails to take place, and practice is often composed of piecemeal, techno-centric tools that isolate analysts by providing rigid, limited levels of understanding of situation awareness. This coupled with the fact that many analyst activities are classified produces a challenging situation for researching such phenomena and designing and evaluating systems to support analyst cognition and teamwork. Through our work with cyber, image, and intelligence analysts we have realized that there is more required of researchers to study human-centered designs to provide for analyst's needs in a timely fashion. This paper identifies and describes how The Living Laboratory Framework can be utilized as a means to develop a comprehensive, human-centric, and problem-focused approach to next generation analyst work, design, and training. We explain how the framework is utilized for specific cases in various applied settings (e.g., crisis management analysis, image analysis, and cyber analysis) to demonstrate its value and power in addressing an area of utmost importance to our national security. Attributes of analyst work settings are delineated to suggest potential design affordances that could help improve cognitive activities and awareness. Finally, the paper puts forth a research agenda for the use of the framework for future work that will move the analyst profession in a viable manner to address the concerns identified.

      This paper summarizes multiple perspectives of the common operational picture (COP) in military and civilian crisis management domains viewed from three vantage points: historical, conceptual, and practical. The term COP extends prior research on large group displays to describe a visual representation of tactical, operational, and strategic information intended to generate situation awareness. We present four strata of interest to formulate an innovative conceptual framework of the COP based on user-team needs: structure, representation, processes, and management. This conceptual framework is applied as part of a review of recent and ongoing projects that examines current research gaps in the application of geographic information systems (GIS) to international humanitarian response.
